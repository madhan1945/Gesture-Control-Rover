# Gesture Controlled Rover

A gesture-controlled robotic rover designed using an Arduino Nano, MPU6050 accelerometer sensor, and NRF24L01 wireless transceiver modules. The roverâ€™s movement is intuitively controlled through hand gestures, with the accelerometer capturing motion data and transmitting it wirelessly to the rover for real-time navigation.

## Features

- Wireless communication using NRF24L01
- Hand gesture detection using MPU6050 accelerometer
- Visual feedback via onboard LEDs for both transmitter and receiver
- Timeout-based auto-stop for safety
- Simple motor control using L298N driver
- Custom command encoding and transmission protocol

## Components Used

### Transmitter

- Arduino Nano
- MPU6050 accelerometer
- NRF24L01 + PA/LNA (optional)
- 3x LEDs for status indicators
- Power source (Battery/USB)

### Receiver

- Arduino Nano
- NRF24L01
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2x DC Motors
- 2x LEDs for communication indicators
- Power source (Battery)

## Code

- `txmitter.ino`: Code for the transmitter (gesture detection and RF transmission)
- `rx.ino`: Code for the receiver (motor control based on commands)
